        <p id="bio_body">
            I am currently a student at the University of Toronto pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Statistics.
            Before university, I was a member of the <a href="https://sirc.ca/news/rca-announces-canammex-team/">Canadian
            Junior National Rowing Team</a>, and a competitive marksman and Cadet Warrant Officer in the <a
                href="http://www.cadets.ca/en/what-cadets-do/army.page">Royal Canadian Army Military Cadet Program.</a>
            <br><br>
            I am a passionate software developer trying to leverage new and existing technologies to solve problems. My
            work has ranged from building a <a href="https://request-to-pay.herokuapp.com/">web app</a> for Scotiabank,
            to building a smart vape designed to help nicotine addicted smokers quit, to engineering a chatbot to help
            quarantined youth through the current COVID-19 pandemic. Regardless of what specific project I am working on,
            my focus is on one thing: creating impact.
            <br><br>
            When I'm not coding, I serve as the student representative for the Computer Science Undergraduate Committee.
            I was also recently promoted to VP of Operations for <a href="https://www.rcif.ca/">Rational Capital
            Investment Fund.</a> In my spare time, I enjoy portrait drawing and I'm currently training to become a pro
            fighting game competitor (message me if you want to run a round of Mortal Kombat 11!).
            <br><br>
            If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am currently based in Toronto but travel to Vancouver and
            New York frequently. Also feel free to check out my socials below, and download my resume! Stay safe!

                            My team and I built a Request-to-Pay application to reduce the friction that currently exists
                            in Scotiabank's invoice processing systems.
                            The project was overseen by the Scotiabank's Global Payments team. The front-end was built
                            using React and the back-end was built using
                            node.js. We hosted our relational database on Heroku and development
                            was done in an agile team. I worked on structuring the backend to support reconciliation so Scotiabank can
                            easily integrate our
                            software into their systems and designing the user interface to change dynamically based on the
                            user's persona.

                            My team and I were accepted into the 2019 NEST cohort to engineer a motion tracking smart
                            mirror that
                            gives user live feedback on his or her workout technique. We managed to raise over $10k in
                            pre-seed investments by pitching to several investors interested in our product.
                            The mirror itself is connected to a prototype mobile application that I built using React
                            that
                            tracks and gather data on the users workout tendencies - this is to prevent injuries as well
                            as
                            to collect valuable data on the workout habits of adults. The video above was shown to
                            garner interest
                            at a live demo we held in Toronto.

                            ability to engage visitors and create unique branding opportunities, as well as lasting
                            experiences.
                            This presents a chance to expose people to the sciences; more specifically, black holes and
                            other
                            phenomena that can be presented in a way that leverages existing VR technologies to make
                            complex
                            concepts digestible and fun. Following the success of an early few exhibits at
                            forward-looking
                            museums such as the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and the Smithsonian, in
                            addition to
                            audiences’ fascination with visuals from movies like Interstellar and Gravity, designing
                            educational
                            VR exhibits around astrophysics becomes an incredibly captivating idea.

                            The aim of this exhibition was to showcase dazzling interactive visual displays of
                            Schwarzschild black
                            holes utilizing the full capabilities of existing VR technologies. To accomplish this, we
                            worked on
                            developing an analytical mathematical framework and parallelized shader implementations to
                            approximate
                            the visual phenomena of Schwarzschild black holes in real time, including aberration,
                            beaming,
                            Doppler shift, Lorenz contraction, and other effects. You can see a preliminary rendering we
                            generated
                            in the video above.
                            <br><br>
                            We were invited to demo our VR exhibit on Schwarzschild Blackholes at the Royal Ontario
                            Museum on International Astronomy Day 2019.

                            The motivation for this project
                            began after learning that Ontario pharmacists
                            will soon be allowed to diagnose and prescribe for
                            minor ailments at their pharmacies, drastically increasing their workload.
                            This presents a potential problem as pharmacists already have to deal with several competing forces that affect their
                            ability to practice what they’re best at, pharmaceutical work.
                            <br><br>
                            Our group wanted to come up with an innovative solution that addresses the key friction points
                            stemming from unnecessary and time-consuming interactions between pharmacists and patients.
                            After extensive user research and many iterations of our high-fidelity prototype, which you
                            can take a look at <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/80ulw14K6UHW2sjVW3iwV4/Untitled?node-id=2%3A4&scaling=scale-down">here,</a>
                            we came up with our kiosk solution. Patients who seek to pick up a new prescription,
                            refill an old prescription, or book a meeting with the pharmacist, can check in using the kiosk.
                            They will then be sent a notification containing all the necessary information on when they
                            should return to the pharmacy.
                            <br><br>
                            Our group was selected to represent our class in a competition adjudicated by
                            UX professionals from Huawei Canada, Chatham Labs, and Klick. Also, check out our teaser

                            Due to COVID-19, many young adults who are currently quarantined are struggling to acclimate to
                            working from home. Managing productivity and physical health are becoming increasingly challenging
                            during these uncertain times and so I wanted to build a chatbot that can help
                            motivate quarantined youth to stay fit and healthy by giving them at-home workout exercises and
                            personal fitness goals to aim for.
                            <br><br>
                            "Quaranteen" Fitness Chatbot is a retrieval based chatbot. I compiled JSON data containing
                            interactive language, fitness exercises and goals, to create training and testing data for the
                            chatbot. I am currently using this data to build a 3-layer deep neural network with
                            Keras to increase accuracy of chatbot and for the eventual chatbot interface.
