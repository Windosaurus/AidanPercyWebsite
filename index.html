            I am currently a student at the University of Toronto pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Statistics.
            Before university, I was a member of the <a href="https://sirc.ca/news/rca-announces-canammex-team/">Canadian
            Junior National Rowing Team</a>,
            and a competitive marksman and Cadet Warrant Officer in the <a
                href="http://www.cadets.ca/en/what-cadets-do/army.page">Royal Canadian Army Military Cadet Program.</a>
            <br><br>
            I am passionate about creating tech solutions to solve problems - I am particularly interested in addressing
            healthcare, enterprise software, and diversity. I enjoy learning and discovering new ideas and
            opportunities. If
            you would like to arrange a meeting, I am currently based in Toronto but travel to Vancouver and New York
            frequently.
            <br><br>
            I recently finished building a <a href="https://request-to-pay.herokuapp.com/">Request-to-Pay app</a>
            for Scotiabank. I am currently leading a team that is developing a smart vape designed to
            help nicotine addicted smokers quit - we do this by gradually reducing
            the flow of nicotine based on the user's smoking tendencies. On campus, I serve as the student
            representative
            for the Computer Science Undergraduate Committee and an analyst and operations intern for the
            <a href="https://www.rcif.ca/">Rational Capital Investment Fund.</a>

                            I built a Request-to-Pay application to reduce the friction centered around invoices in
                            Scotiabank's payment systems.
                            The project was overseen by the Scotiabank's Global Payments team. The front-end is built
                            using React and the back-end was built using
                            PostgreSQL. I worked on structuring the backend to support reconciliation so Scotiabank can
                            easily integrate our
                            software into their systems and designing the interface to change dynamically based on the
                            user's persona.

                            differentiation for literature review and helped develop six surveys using Qualtrics to test

                            My team and I were accepted into the 2019 NEST cohort to engineer a motion tracking smart
                            mirror that
                            gives user live feedback on his or her workout technique. We managed to raise over $10k in
                            pre-seed investments by pitching to several investors interested in our product.
                            The mirror itself is connected to a prototype mobile application that I built using React
                            that
                            tracks and gather data on the users workout tendencies - this is to prevent injuries as well
                            as
                            to collect valuable data on the workout habits of adults. The video above was shown to
                            garner interest
                            at a live demo we held in Toronto.

                            There is currently an unaddressed absence of VR exhibitions in museums. VR exhibits have a
                            unique
                            ability to engage visitors and create unique branding opportunities, as well as lasting
                            experiences.
                            This presents a chance to expose people to the sciences; more specifically, black holes and
                            other
                            phenomena that can be presented in a way that leverages existing VR technologies to make
                            complex
                            concepts digestible and fun. Following the success of an early few exhibits at
                            forward-looking
                            museums such as the National Museum of Natural History in Paris and the Smithsonian, in
                            addition to
                            audiences’ fascination with visuals from movies like Interstellar and Gravity, designing
                            educational
                            VR exhibits around astrophysics becomes an incredibly captivating idea.

                            The aim of this exhibition was to showcase dazzling interactive visual displays of
                            Schwarzschild black
                            holes utilizing the full capabilities of existing VR technologies. To accomplish this, we
                            worked on
                            developing an analytical mathematical framework and parallelized shader implementations to
                            approximate
                            the visual phenomena of Schwarzschild black holes in real time, including aberration,
                            beaming,
                            Doppler shift, Lorenz contraction, and other effects. You can see a preliminary rendering we
                            generated
                            in the video above.

                            We were invited to demo our VR exhibit on Schwarzschild Blackholes at the Royal Ontario
                            Museum on International Astronomy Day 2019.
